# 🧠 NeuroChurn

**Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**  
A deep learning project designed to predict customer churn using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn is a key metric in many industries. In this project, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer is likely to leave based on various input features.

This model is trained on the **Churn Modelling Dataset** and includes all the essential steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
